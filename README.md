minecraft modpack for vanilla MP servers. Includes way too much QoL mods.

## Why?

Each time a server admin updates their mc version, I have to start from scratch and re-download my minecraft mods again.

So I thought to myself, what if I create a schema of mods that can automatically update with a single POSIX script (or even github action)? That would be cool.

So, this is my attempt to create my own modpack.
